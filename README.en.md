# 🌌 Dreamy Ocean

**Dreamy Ocean** is a REAPER theme inspired by a dream I had—one where I was exploring sounds inside the DAW, but everything looked... alive.
The background resembled the universe itself, tracks shimmered like crystal, and waveform peaks trailed across the screen like comets.

This theme is my attempt to recreate that airy, immersive vision.
I hope it shares a fragment of that dream with you—and maybe even inspires you to create and share your own.
