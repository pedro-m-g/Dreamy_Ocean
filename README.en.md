# Dreamy Ocean

Dreamy Ocean is a REAPER theme, inspired by a dream I had, where I explored different sounds in the DAW, but instead of looking as usual, with the
default theme, it looked as if it were alive in some way. The background resembled the universe itself. Tracks appeared to be made of some kind of crystal. Sound waves looked like a comet trail. This theme is the closest I could get to bring those dream visuals into real life - that dreamy and lightweight, yet deep and immersive sensation. I hope this theme is able to share at least a bit of that dream with you, and inspires you to dream, create, and share, just like it did for me.
