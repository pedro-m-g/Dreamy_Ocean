# Dreamy Ocean

Dreamy Ocean is a REAPER theme, inspired in a dream
I had, where I explored different sounds in the
DAW, but instead of looking as usual, with the
default theme, it looked as it was alive, in a way.
Background looked as the background of the universe
itself. Tracks looked as if they were made of some
sort of crystal. Sound waves looked like a comet
trail. This theme is the closest I could get to
bring that dream visuals into real life, that
dreamy and lightweight, but also deep and immersive
sensation. I hope this theme is able to share at
least a bit of that dream with you, and inspires you
to dream, and create, and share, just like it did
for me.
