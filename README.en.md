# Dreamy Ocean

Dreamy Ocean is a REAPER theme, inspired by a dream I had, where I explored different sounds in the DAW, but instead of looking as usual, with the
default theme, it looked as if it were alive in some way. The background resembled the universe itself, tracks looked crystalline, and the sound-wave peaks trailed like comets. Dreamy Ocean is my attempt to recreate that airy yet immersive vision. I hope the theme can share a fragment of that dream with you and inspire you to create and share in turn.
